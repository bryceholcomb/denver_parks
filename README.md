#Mile High Parks
Mile High Parks is an app built to help educate Denver residents on the sheer amount of parks as well as what facilities are available to them.

It is a Ruby on Rails application hosted on Heroku that utilizes Denver's open data platform for park data, and Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

This app was built during the Rocky Mountain Civic Hackathon over the course of 4 days ending on MLK Jr. Day, 2015.
